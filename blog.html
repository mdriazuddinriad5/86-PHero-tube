        <p class="text-xl md:text-3xl font-semibold underline">The scope of var, let, and const:</p>
        <p class="mt-1 md:mt-2 text-justify text-base md:text-xl font-normal">Scope refers to the accessible zone of a variable. In the case
            of var, a variable declared using var, whether
            locally or globally, is hoisted to the top of the function or script. This means it can be accessed from
            anywhere within the function or the script. <br>
            In contrast, a variable declared with let is limited in scope to the function or script in which it is
            declared. If it is declared within a function, it is only accessible within that specific function. However,
            when a variable declared with let is declared globally, its scope extends to the entire script. <br>
            In terms of scope, const behaves similarly to let. The key difference is that any variable declared with
            const cannot have its value updated once it has been assigned.</p>
        <p class="text-xl md:text-3xl font-semibold underline mt-4">The use cases of null and undefined:</p>
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl font-medium underline mt-2">Undefined:</p>
        <p class="mt-1 md:mt-2 text-justify text-base md:text-xl font-normal">1. A variable that is declared but not initiated is assigned
            the undefined value. <br>
            2. A function with no explicit return will return undefined. <br>
            3. If value of parameter of a function is not passed then it will return undefined. <br>
            4. Trying to access of a property of an object that is missing, will return undefined. <br>
            5. Trying to access index value of an array that is out of the index range of that array will return
            undefined. <br>
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl font-medium underline mt-2">Null:</p>
        <p class="mt-1 md:mt-2 text-justify text-base md:text-xl font-normal">1. A variable can be declared with null value. <br>
            2. In conditional statement null is used to avoid error. <br>
            3. To clear reference of an object property null is used. <br>
            4. In object null is used to represent empty fields. <br>
            5. In array null is used to indicate missing value. <br>
        </p>

        <p class="text-xl md:text-3xl font-semibold underline mt-4">What do I mean by REST API?</p>
        <p class="mt-1 md:mt-2 text-justify text-base md:text-xl font-normal mb-8 lg:mb-10">REST stands for Representative State Transfer. Rest API is a
            standardized software architecture style. It's all about communication between a client and a server. The
            main building block of a REST API is sending a request to the server and returning a response to the client.
            In the request, CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are performed. In a REST API, the primary
            things for communicating with the client-server are CRUD operations. The equivalent of CRUD in a REST API is
            HTTP methods. In these methods, POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE are equivalent to the CRUD operations. It follows
            a stateless client-server model, which means the server doesn't store any information about the client's
            state between requests. It's scalable and easy to maintain, making it suitable for applications like
            streaming services and chat applications.</p>
